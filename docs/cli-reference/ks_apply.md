## ks apply

Apply local Kubernetes manifests to remote clusters

### Synopsis



Update (or optionally create) Kubernetes resources on the cluster using your
local Kubernetes manifests. Use the `--create` flag to control whether
they are created if they do not exist (default: true).

The local Kubernetes manifests that are applied reside in your `components/`
directory. When applied, the manifests are fully expanded using the paremeters
of the specified environment.

By default, all manifests are applied. To apply a subset of manifests, use the
`--component` flag, as seen in the examples below.

### Related Commands

* `ks delete` â€” Delete the component manifests on your cluster

### Syntax


```
ks apply <env-name>
```

### Examples

```

# Create or update all resources described in a ksonnet application, and
# running in the 'dev' environment. Can be used in any subdirectory of the
# application.
#
# This is equivalent to applying all components in the 'components/' directory.
ks apply dev

# Create or update the single resource 'guestbook-ui' described in a ksonnet
# application, and running in the 'dev' environment. Can be used in any
# subdirectory of the application.
#
# This is equivalent to applying the component with the same file name (excluding
# the extension) 'guestbook-ui' in the 'components/' directory.
ks apply dev -c guestbook-ui

# Create or update the multiple resources, 'guestbook-ui' and 'nginx-depl'
# described in a ksonnet application, and running in the 'dev' environment. Can
# be used in any subdirectory of the application.
#
# This is equivalent to applying the component with the same file name (excluding
# the extension) 'guestbook-ui' and 'nginx-depl' in the 'components/' directory.
ks apply dev -c guestbook-ui -c nginx-depl

```
