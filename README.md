*ksonnet* is a framework for writing, sharing, and deploying Kubernetes application manifests. With its CLI, you can generate a complete application from scratch in only a few commands, or manage a complex system at scale.

Specifically, ksonnet allows you to:
* *Reuse* common manifest patterns (within your app or from external libraries)
* *Customize* manifests directly with powerful object concatenation syntax
* *Deploy* app manifests to multiple environments
* *Diff* across environments to compare two running versions of your app
* *Track* the entire state of your app manifests in version control

*STATUS: Development is ongoingâ€”this tool is pre-alpha.*

## Install

To build from source:

```console
% PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
% go get github.com/ksonnet/ksonnet
```

Requires golang >=1.7 and a functional cgo environment (C++ with libstdc++).
Note that recent OSX environments
[require golang >=1.8.1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19734) to
avoid an immediate `Killed: 9`.

## Quickstart

```console
# Include <ksonnet.git>/lib in ksonnet/jsonnet library search path.
# Can also use explicit `-J` args everywhere.
% export KUBECFG_JPATH=/path/to/ksonnet/lib

# Show generated YAML
% ks show -o yaml -f examples/guestbook.jsonnet

# Create resources
% ks apply -f examples/guestbook.jsonnet

# Modify configuration (downgrade gb-frontend image)
% sed -i.bak '\,gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend,s/:v4/:v3/' examples/guestbook.jsonnet
# See differences vs server
% ks diff -f examples/guestbook.jsonnet

# Update to new config
% ks apply -f examples/guestbook.jsonnet

# Clean up after demo
% ks delete -f examples/guestbook.jsonnet
```

## Features

- Supports JSON, YAML or jsonnet files (by file suffix).
- Best-effort sorts objects before updating, so that dependencies are
  pushed to the server before objects that refer to them.
- Additional jsonnet builtin functions. See `lib/kubecfg.libsonnet`.

## Infrastructure-as-code Philosophy

The idea is to describe *as much as possible* about your configuration
as files in version control (eg: git).

Changes to the configuration follow a regular review, approve, merge,
etc code change workflow (github pull-requests, phabricator diffs,
etc).  At any point, the config in version control captures the entire
desired-state, so the system can be easily recreated in a QA cluster
or to recover from disaster.

### Jsonnet

ksonnet relies heavily on [jsonnet](http://jsonnet.org/) to describe
Kubernetes resources, and is really just a thin Kubernetes-specific
wrapper around jsonnet evaluation.  You should read the jsonnet
[tutorial](http://jsonnet.org/docs/tutorial.html), and skim the functions available in the jsonnet [`std`](http://jsonnet.org/docs/stdlib.html)
library.
